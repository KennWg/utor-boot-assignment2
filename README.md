# This is my portfolio webpage, built for the Bootcamp Assignment 2.  There are placeholders in place at the moment for when this becomes an actual portfolio, like a recent image of myself and my resume.  Future projects will also be
added here. Currently only Run-Buddy (project 1) is a working link, whereas projects 2-5 are just placeholders.
